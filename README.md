# Flappy Kotlin

Recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game. My first attempt at libGDX and Kotlin for Android.

## Build and run
* Desktop - run ```./gradlew desktop:dist``` from project root. Then run with ``` java -jar desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar```
* Android - Package the APK using your favorite software, no special settings required. I used a regular usb cable and the default settings of Android Studio to install the .apk to my phone.
More info can be found [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Deploying-your-application#deploy-to-android)

## Built With

* [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) - Game development framework 
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Build tool
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Programming language
